                        At Senti Guide, we believe that every student’s opinion matters. This platform allows students to freely express their thoughts and share valuable insights on various school events, helping us capture the overall sentiment and experiences of our campus community. By analyzing feedback, we can recognize what resonates with students and identify areas for improvement, creating a stronger connection between students and event organizers.
                        <br><br>
                        Through Senti Guide, the SSG aims to foster an open feedback culture where your voice is a vital part of our planning process. Together, we’re building events that reflect the interests, needs, and values of BISU-Clarin, making each event more meaningful and impactful. Your feedback shapes the future of our campus experiences, and we thank you for being a part of this journey.
